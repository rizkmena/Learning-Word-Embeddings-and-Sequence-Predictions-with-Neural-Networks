# Learning-Word-Embeddings-and-Sequence-Predictions-with-Neural-Networks

In this project we explore word embeddings and develop neural networks to learn about words.

We could try to match statistics about the words, or we could train a network that takes a sequence of words as input and learns to predict the word that comes next. In this project, we choose the latter.
        
We implement a linear embedding and then the backpropagation computations for a neural language model and then run some experiments to analyze the learned representation. We derive the updates mathematically, and then implement them using matrix and vector operations in NumPy.
